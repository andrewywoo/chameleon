This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Chameleon

This project was started to bring together my recent learning of React and CSS3. The application consists of a couple of components that showcase knowledge of state changes, prop passing, event handlers, as well as things such as flexflow, css grid, modals, svgs.

### `npm install`

This will install all the necessary node pacakges using NPM manager.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
